# This is an executable code implementation of the paper BrainBMT: Geometric Deep Learning for Clinical Subtyping via Multi-batch Brain Network Fusion.
## The simulation dataset can be got in https://github.com/liujiawen-jpg/simulated-SPD-data/tree/main.
## For a demonstration of our code, you can refer to the toy example in: BrainBMT/simulated_1.ipynb.
